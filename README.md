# ODES: Online Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Medical Image Segmentation 

Code for **ODES**, accepted in MICCAI 2025 (Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention), Daejeon, South Korea. (under construction)

ODES is a novel framework for **online domain adaptation** in medical image segmentation that combines active learning, image pruning, and diversity-guided annotation to adapt pre-trained models to distribution shifts in real-time.

## ‚ú® Key Contributions

- **First AL-based online UDA framework** for medical image segmentation.
- Novel **image pruning** strategy based on batch norm divergence to select informative images.
- A **diversity-aware acquisition** function using spatial and feature-wise distances to enhance annotation utility.
- Online, source-free, and storage-free adaptation: data is processed **once per batch**.



### Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn


### Run Demo

```bash
python demo_ODES.py --cfg cfgs/example_config.yaml
```

Edit your YAML config to match your dataset path and parameters.
